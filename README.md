## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

We have built a robust **Decoupled Full-Stack** solution:

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn, Pydantic, FPDF2.
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+), Three.js, Chart.js.

## ▶️ Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** — [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip** — Comes bundled with Python
- Modern Web Browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)

### ⚙️ Step 1: Clone & Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository (or download ZIP)
git clone <repo-url>
cd SugarNxt_Hackathon_2026/ThermaVision

# Create and activate virtual environment
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Activate:
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Windows (CMD):
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Mac / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 📦 Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Inside the backend directory with venv active
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🖥️ Step 3: Launch Backend Server

```bash
# From the backend directory
python run.py
```

You should see: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### 🌐 Step 4: Launch Frontend (New Terminal)

```bash
# Open a NEW terminal, navigate to the frontend folder
cd SugarNxt_Hackathon_2026/ThermaVision/frontend

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 3000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

You should see: `Serving HTTP on :: port 3000 ...`

### 🖱️ Step 5: Open in Browser

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — The ThermaVision portal is now live!

> **Important:** Keep both terminals running. The frontend (port 3000) sends API requests to the backend (port 8080).
